### Tracking for Google AMP for Email


SendGrid’s v3 mail/send API now supports click and open tracking for AMP content. Please note that [Google requires](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/amp-email-format#the-amphtml-email-format) all links to be HTTPS, which will require customers who wish to track links to do additional setup with their [SSL certificates]({{root_url}}/ui/analytics-and-reporting/click-tracking-ssl/) to ensure that their recipients do not see SSL Cert warnings in their browsers during the click-tracking redirection. SendGrid’s v2 Mail API does not support the custom MIME parts required for AMP, therefore we recommend customers [migrate]({{root_url}}/for-developers/sending-email/migrating-from-v2-to-v3-mail-send/) to the v3 API to use AMP. For more information on Google AMP for Email see Google’s [documentation](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/amp-email-format#the-amphtml-email-format).
