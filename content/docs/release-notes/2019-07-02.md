New Marketing Campaigns - Early Access

A brand new version of Marketing Campaigns is now in Early Access, with the addition of [Automation](https://sendgrid.com/solutions/marketing-automation/), [Email Testing](https://sendgrid.com/solutions/email-marketing-testing/?ts=1559925149), and [Signup Forms](https://sendgrid.com/solutions/signup-forms/). These new features are incremental to the existing functionality for one-to-many campaign sending, contact management, real-time analytics, and more.
