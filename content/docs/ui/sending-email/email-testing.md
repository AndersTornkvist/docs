<call-out>

Email Testing is available as part of the Advanced Marketing Campaigns package. To access this feature, please upgrade to Advanced Marketing Campaigns from [Your Products](https://app.sendgrid.com/account/billing).

</call-out>

Email testing offers robust, pre-send testing of your emails, including in-app spam testing, inbox rendering previews, and link validation right within your Marketing Campaigns workflow. It allows you to preview how an email is likely to perform across a wide range of inbox providers, devices and spam filters, before sending.

- **Inbox Rendering Test:** Displays how an email message is rendered and appears across a select group of inbox providers and devices.
- **Spam Test:** Shows how an email performs against the worldâ€™s most powerful consumer (B2C) and enterprise (B2B) spam filters.
- **Link Validation Test:** Tests all links within a message to ensure they are valid. The test checks for redirects, domain reputation, and critical metadata, like title text. Your inbox rendering tests will automatically include this link validation test. Link validation tests **do not** deduct from your Email Testing credits.

## Email Testing credits and pricing

Email Testing credits can be used for both Inbox Rendering Tests and Spam Tests. A Spam Test costs 3 Email Testing credits, while an Inbox Rendering Test will cost 1 credit for every client, browser or device that you select. Check your plan to see how many email testing credits are available to you for free per month.
